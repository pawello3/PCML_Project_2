#TODO list

###Everybody
[DONE] 1. Choose one of the three possible topics. Related Kaggle competitions:
	* https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/epfml-rec-sys
	* https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/epfml-text
	* https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/epfml-segmentation
--> We have decided to take recommender system.  
2. Register the team (we're still waiting for instructions)  
VERY ROUGH DESCRIPTION  
[DONE]3. data_set is given in specific form-make it be matrix NxN where on i,j position is rating for i-th movie and j-th user  
4. decide which libraries to use, scikit and panda are first choices, but think about it  
5. make basic model which would predict missing rating using matrix factorisation  
6. make cross-validation to check basic accuracy of prediction  
7. upload first submission-make .csv file  
deadline: in a few days-this first points should not be so difficult  
8. add data preprocessing-it is not clear to me what should be done here for recommendation systems, but this is surely big point  
9. see other ways to make better model except matrix factorisation  
10. determine if model overfitts or underfits and set parameters and do regularisation according to that  
11. do some kind of visualisation of model, this could be done as any step, just to see how model works  
12. WRITE A REPORT - VERY IMPORTANT  
13. SUBMIT FINAL WORKING SOLUTION
